a script for DFS analyzer

MLS, maximum length sequence, this is the sound you hear when you press calibrate.
so, MLS is the stimulus of this feedback system which we can specify amplitude in ALT

DFSInit.init_front = accumulated response on front mic (MLS+impulse response)
  This accumulated response is used internally in the DFS modeler to calculate the impulse response, which is
  the accumulated response convolved with the MLS(compensated with some circular delay ect.)

DFSInit.init_resp_front = Impulse Response on front mic (MLS - accumulated response)
  the impulse response tells us the characteristics of the feedback path (transfer function from receiver to microphone,
  so the characteristics of the ear + HI is included here also). we usually deal with the feedback path in frequency domain,
  and since the impulse response is in the time, we make an FFT to obtain the frequency characteristics.
  this becomes the MSG curve (msg_dfs_off)

DFSInit.ImpulseResponseFront = DFSInit.init_resp_front.
  i don't know why two same variable but named different are need.

DFSInit.front.msg_dfs_off = MSG when DFS is off (calibration not included)

to obtain the red line in ALT (MSG) by transforming init_resp_front to frequency domain and included system
and production calibrations (or take the msg_dfs_off and include calibration, i just prefer the other way)
  msg_dfs_off + system calibration = MSG
  MSG covers all frequency from DC to FS/2
    however, the variations on low frequencies are so large that we don't show them in ALT (and they are not
    important here neither as feedback usually occurs above 1kHz).
    Also, the anti aliasing filter kicks in around 9kHz, so on very high frequencies close to fs/2, there we don't care eigher

!!! But, this MSG is not equal to the MSG_From_OPL, that is because the H bridge is not included.
Here, the MSG is the maximum gain setting we can set in HI. and the MSG the frequency response
of the feedback path (receiver to microphone), that does not include the Hybric
    MSG_here + gain(setting0)_711 = MSG_From_OPL

in case of dual mic, then it is worse case between the two curves that determines MSG for each frequency


TCDFS,
in the preliminary Dooku2 release for Cambridge, one issue found. the coefficients for the feedback filter was
not written correctly during TCDFS init.
  and this is solved in the following database patch:\\Hearing\Data\Releases\AlgorithmDeliveries\Dooku2\Dooku1Cambridge1\DB Patch (TCDFS + CDI Creation)\RatatoskConfiguration.sdf
in AlgolabTest you can only see the MSG for TC in the TelecoilMic1 input mode, when no DFS initialization have
been done for the mics. in the latter case you will only see MSG for the mics.
  i guess the reason for this is, that the MSG for telecoil is normally much higher and relevant in TelecoilMic1 scenarios
