a script for DFS analyzer

MLS, maximum length sequence, this is the sound you hear when you press calibrate

DFSInit.init_front = accumulated response on front mic (MLS+impulse response)
DFSInit.init_resp_front = Impulse Response on front mic (MLS - accumulated response)
DFSInit.front.msg_dfs_off = MSG when DFS is off (calibration not included)

to obtain the red line in ALT (MSG) by transforming init_front to frequency domain and included system calibrations
and production calibration (or take the msg_dfs_off and include calibration, i just prefer the other way)

in case of dual mic, then it is worse case between the two curves that determines MSG for each frequency
