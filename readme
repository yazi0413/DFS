a script for DFS analyzer

MLS, maximum length sequence, this is the sound you hear when you press calibrate.
so, MLS is the stimulus of this feedback system which we can specify amplitude in ALT

DFSInit.init_front = accumulated response on front mic (MLS+impulse response)
  This accumulated response is used internally in the DFS modeler to calculate the impulse response, which is
  the accumulated response convolved with the MLS(compensated with some circular delay ect.)

DFSInit.init_resp_front = Impulse Response on front mic (MLS - accumulated response)
  the impulse response tells us the characteristics of the feedback path (transfer function from receiver to microphone,
  so the characteristics of the ear + HI is included here also). we usually deal with the feedback path in frequency domain,
  and since the impulse response is in the time, we make an FFT to obtain the frequency characteristics.
  this becomes the MSG curve (msg_dfs_off)

DFSInit.front.msg_dfs_off = MSG when DFS is off (calibration not included)

to obtain the red line in ALT (MSG) by transforming init_front to frequency domain and included system calibrations
and production calibration (or take the msg_dfs_off and include calibration, i just prefer the other way)
  msg_dfs_off + system calibration = MSG
  MSG covers all frequency from DC to FS/2
    however, the variations on low frequencies are so large that we don't show them in ALT (and they are not
    important here neither as feedback usually occurs above 1kHz).
    Also, the anti aliasing filter kicks in around 9kHz, so on very high frequencies close to fs/2, there we don't care eigher
    

in case of dual mic, then it is worse case between the two curves that determines MSG for each frequency
